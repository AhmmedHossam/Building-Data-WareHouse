# Building-Data-WareHouse
Welcome to the Data Warehouse and Analytics Project repository! ðŸš€
This project demonstrates a comprehensive data warehousing and analytics solution, from building a data warehouse to generating actionable insights.

The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers:
1- Bronze Layer: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2-Silver Layer: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3- Gold Layer: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.
